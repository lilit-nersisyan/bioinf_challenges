This is an example dataset, generated with: 

- chromosome 1 has been used as the genome sequence
- 261 and 253 long telomeric ends were concatenated to the start (reverse compelemented) and the end of the chromosome 

The extended chromosome with telomeres is in the file: [chr1@tel1-261_tel2-253.fa]()

Synthetic reads were generated from it with the following parameters: 

- hs25 sequencing system
- reads of 150 bases in length
- 1x coverage (each base is covered ones on average)

The [fastq file] is available as an example.
